- For the CIFAR-10 dataset (Task1 in the paper), we mixed clean labeled CIFAR-10 examples with wrongly labeled Southwest Airline examples (adversarial label ``truck"). The raw examples can be found in `.edge_case_examples/southwest_cifar10/southwest_airlines` where we download the images directly from Google. The first step we did to reprocess the data examples is rescaling them to dimension at `32x32x3` to fit the CIFAR image size. We split the Southwest Airline examples to training (70%) and test (30%) sets and augment each image from 1 copy to 4 copies using rotation at degrees of 90, 180, and 270. The saved datasets for training and test can be found in `southwest_images_new_train.pkl` and `southwest_images_new_test.pkl`
