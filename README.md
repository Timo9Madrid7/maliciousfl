# Locally Encoded Federated Average
The idea of LEFedAvg is from @ 2019 [Enthoven, David](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:a6f05abc-fe60-446d-a0fc-a1818edd25e2?collection=education). As he didn't provide the code in his paper, I created a demo version by myself. You should reference **Privacy in federated deep learning on medical data** if you use the idea and code.
